# The Popular Movies Android App

The Popular Movies Android app, was made as part of Udacity's **Android Developer Nanodegree Program**. This app was created from scratch and has adaptive UI for phone and tablet devices. It displays the **_Most Popular_** and **_Top Rated_** Movies. The User has the ability to save favourite movies locally and view them even when the device is offline. After selecting a movie, they will be presented with the movie details (rating, release date, duration, etc.), trailers, reviews and the option to share the movie.

## Download:

You can download an APK build on [releases page]().


## Instructions for Developers

The app fetches movie information using The Movie Database (TMDb) API. In order to use the code, you have to enter your own API key into gradle.properties file.

```Groovy
MOVIE_DB_API_KEY="Your Api Key"
```

If you donâ€™t already have a TMDb API key, you will need to create an account and request your own API Key - [TMDb link](link to API Key page)
